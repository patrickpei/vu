## Recall: Next-Fit
- Only one bin open at the time
- 2 * OPTIMAL
- Other bin-packing algorithms
    - First-fit
- Both next-fit first-fit are online algorithms
    - Receive input and immediately use
    - Any online: 3/2 OPTIMAL

## Non-increasing first fit
- Sort items, use first-fit
- Upper bound derivation
- Extra bins: bins that the optimal solution doesn't use
- Extra object: object that goes in an extra bin
-
