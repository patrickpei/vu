## DFS
- DFS tree
- Runtime O(m + n)
    - "linear" for a graph
- Edges wrt tree
    - tree edges
        - 
    - back edges
        - ancestors & descendants
    - cross edges
- No cross edges wrt dfs tree

## BFS trees
    - no edges that are back edges which are tree edges

## Digraph
- Cross edges in DFS tree (of digraph)

## Definitions
- articulation point:
    - v such that G\v is disconnected
    -
