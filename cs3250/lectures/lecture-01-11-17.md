## Order Notation
- Arithmetic (way of representation) to ignore constants
- Types:
    - BigO: <=
    - Theta: =
    - Omega: >=
- Case:
    - Worst case
        - Guarantee about longest possible
    - Average case
        - hard to always know
    - Best case
- Examples
    - Generalized

## Analysis of Algorithms
- determine running time (usually worst-case, average-case when relevant)
- don't know how to prove problems are difficult
- can't prove when running time is > n

### Homework
- To do
- Completed
