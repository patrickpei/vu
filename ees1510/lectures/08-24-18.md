- looked at topographic maps
- with a partner, label the geological features of world map:
    1. mountains
    2. volcanoes
- oceanic crust vs continental
    - isostasy: denser objects sink, less dense objects float
    - in class demonstration of ice & water
    - predict the density of ice given that:
        1. ice floats in water and water has a density of 1g / cm^3
        2. ice sinks in alcohol and alcohol has a density of .8g / cm^3
